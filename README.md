# A small explanation of how to use this tool:
<b>
This is the bolo sword custom heirloom
 <b>
1. Extract this tool into a folder somewhere. <b>

2. Drag and drop Common_sdk.json onto Repak.exe <b>
  
3. When you do this you will see a cmd line for a brief second and there will be 2 files inside of the build folder. <b>
  
4. Drag those files into the paks/Win64 Folder in your R5Reloaded directory <b>
  
## Adding custom textures:

[Texture Expanation](https://github.com/MCLOLSMAN/common_sdk.rpak/blob/main/Texture%2C%20material%20info.txt)
Make sure that the textures are IN ORDER when adding custom ones. <b>
  Repak is very picky with the DDS texture files. Make sure not to edit them with Gimp, Use paint.net.
